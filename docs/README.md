# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Welcome

This documentation folder serves as the central entry point for understanding how OctoAcme manages projects, from initial concept to successful delivery and continuous improvement. Whether you're a new team member getting up to speed or an experienced contributor looking for specific process details, these documents provide a comprehensive guide to our project management practices, roles, and workflows.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five core principles: customer-first thinking, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Every project follows a structured lifecycle that balances planning with flexibility, ensuring teams can deliver value while adapting to changing requirements. Projects are led by a Project Manager who coordinates delivery and a Product Manager who defines outcomes, supported by cross-functional teams including developers, QA specialists, and stakeholders who provide input and approvals.

The project lifecycle begins with **Initiation**, where teams validate business needs, align stakeholders, and create a project one-pager that defines the problem, goals, success metrics, and high-level timeline. Once approved, projects move into **Planning**, where the team breaks work into shippable increments, estimates scope, identifies dependencies, and creates a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria. During **Execution and Tracking**, teams build, test, and iterate on features through regular sprints, maintaining transparency via standups, project boards, and weekly syncs while continuously monitoring progress against milestones.

Throughout the project, **Risk Management and Communication** ensure potential blockers are identified early and addressed proactively. Teams maintain a risk register that tracks impact, likelihood, and mitigation plans, while stakeholder communication follows a regular cadence—weekly syncs between PM and Product Manager, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates. When features are ready, the **Release and Deployment** process guides teams through final validation, deployment verification, and launch announcements, ensuring quality and stability.

Every project concludes with a **Retrospective** session where the team reflects on what went well, what could improve, and what actions to take forward. This commitment to continuous improvement, combined with clearly defined roles and consistent communication patterns, enables OctoAcme to deliver reliable software while fostering a culture of learning and collaboration. The documentation in this folder provides detailed guidance for each phase, ensuring teams have the resources they need to succeed.
